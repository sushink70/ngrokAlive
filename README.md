# Ngrok Tunnel Launcher

This project provides a simple Python script to launch an [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) tunnel that forwards traffic from a local address (`127.0.0.2:8081`) to a publicly accessible URL. This tool is useful for exposing local services (e.g., during development or testing webhooks) without deploying them to a production environment.

## Features

- **Automatic Tunnel Initialization**: Starts the ngrok tunnel automatically.
- **Configurable Delay**: Waits for a specified time to ensure ngrok has properly initialized.
- **Structured Logging**: Provides clear runtime messages using Pythonâ€™s `logging` module.
- **Portable and Simple**: Written in Python 3, easy to configure and extend.

## Prerequisites

Before running this script, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.x**: The script is compatible with Python 3.
- **ngrok**: Download and install ngrok from [ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com/). The script assumes the ngrok binary is located at `/home/ubuntu/ngrokFunctionalities/./ngrok`.
- **Local Service**: A service running on `127.0.0.2:8081` that you wish to expose.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ngrok-tunnel-launcher.git
   cd ngrok-tunnel-launcher
   ```

2. **Verify the ngrok Binary**

   Make sure the ngrok binary exists at the expected location. If not, update the `NGROK_PATH` constant in the script accordingly.

## Usage

Make sure the script is executable:

```bash
chmod +x run_ngrok.py
```

Then, run the script using one of the following methods:

- **Direct Execution:**

  ```bash
  ./run_ngrok.py
  ```

- **Via Python Interpreter:**

  ```bash
  python3 run_ngrok.py
  ```

The script will launch the ngrok tunnel and wait for a short period (default: 2 seconds) to allow the tunnel to initialize.

## Configuration

The following constants can be modified in the script to suit your environment:

- **NGROK_PATH**: Path to the ngrok binary.  
  _Default:_ `/home/ubuntu/ngrokFunctionalities/./ngrok`

- **NGROK_ARGS**: Arguments to pass to ngrok.  
  _Default:_ `["http", "127.0.0.2:8081"]`

- **INITIALIZATION_DELAY**: Number of seconds to wait after launching ngrok.  
  _Default:_ `2`

## Logging

The script uses the Python `logging` module to output status messages. The logging configuration is set to `INFO` level by default and outputs to the console. Adjust the logging level and format within the script if needed.
